  > ‚ú® **Plexer Reborn** is a modernized and enhanced version of the original Plexer project. It offers a revamped user interface, improved features, and new tools to make downloading files from Plex shares even more convenient.

  ## Original Project

  This project is based on the original **Plexer** by **elias**. The original repository can be found here:
  [eliasthecactus/Plexer](https://github.com/eliasthecactus/Plexer)

  ## Usage

  The usage instructions from the original project are still relevant:
  Visit [Plexer (Original)](https://eliasthecactus.github.io/Plexer/) for HTTPS or use [HTTP Plexer (Original)](http://plexer.rf.gd/) if the Plex Server runs on HTTP.

  **Plexer Reborn:** Web version: [https://plexer-reborn.vercel.app/](https://plexer-reborn.vercel.app/).

  ## ‚ú® Plexer Reborn - New Features & Improvements

  *   **Completely Modernized User Interface:**
      *   Sidebar layout for clear navigation.
      *   Modern color scheme and typography.
      *   Redesigned media cards and popups with animations.
  *   **Enhanced Media Interactions:**
      *   Tabular episode list with checkboxes for custom M3U creation.
      *   Inline video player for movies and episodes.
        *   (Note: Inline video playback is currently only compatible with Chromium-based browsers.)
      *   Direct download, JDownloader integration, link copying, and M3U creation for individual episodes, seasons, and movies.
      *   **VLC Integration:** Open media directly in VLC media player.
        *   Requires the [VLC-Linker](https://github.com/BotAwesome/VLC-linker) tool to be installed for the `vlc://` protocol to work.
        *   If you don't have VLC media player installed, you can download it from the [official VLC website](https://www.videolan.org/).
        *   The VLC-linker tool sends a command to PowerShell to open the stream in your installed VLC media player.
        *   Works for both movies and individual episodes.
  *   **Search History:** Saves and displays previous search queries.
  *   **Planned: Bookmarks:** Functionality to save and manage bookmarks for media items.
  *   And many more improvements in UI/UX!

  ## ü§ù Contributing
  Currently, contributions are not actively sought for Plexer Reborn. This was mostly a fun, one-night side project born out of boredom, with limited time for ongoing maintenance. The next and likely final planned feature is the implementation of bookmarks.
