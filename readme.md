> ‚ú® **Plexer Reborn** is a modernized and enhanced version of the original Plexer project. It offers a revamped user interface, improved features, and new tools to make downloading files from Plex shares even more convenient.

## Original Project

This project is based on the original **Plexer** by **elias**. The original repository can be found here:
[eliasthecactus/Plexer](https://github.com/eliasthecactus/Plexer)

## Usage

The usage instructions from the original project are still relevant:
Visit [Plexer (Original)](https://eliasthecactus.github.io/Plexer/) for HTTPS or use [HTTP Plexer (Original)](http://plexer.rf.gd/) if the Plex Server runs on HTTP.

**Note for Plexer Reborn:** This project is currently developed locally and is not publicly hosted.

## ü§ù Contributing
Currently, contributions are not actively sought for Plexer Reborn. This was mostly a fun, one-night side project born out of boredom, with limited time for ongoing maintenance. The next and likely final planned feature is the implementation of bookmarks.
